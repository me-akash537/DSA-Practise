Inside each folder, you will find problems from different websites. It is not that I jump between platforms; I simply prefer to keep everything organized so that I can easily find problems later when needed.

As I am starting out, I learn topics one by one and solve problems on LeetCode. Apart from learning the basics of a new topic, I use Codeforces for additional practice and contests.

If a problem goes into my notes, I name the file in the format `pno_filename.cpp`. For example: `027_bitmanipulation.cpp`.

Also, I use AI at several places to clean up, or somtimes to fasten up basic stuff. But trust me, I am actually writing all of this code myself.
